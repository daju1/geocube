.SH "DESCRIPTION"
RrowCol2Coords computes the true world co-ordinate from a
row, column index. The row,column co-ordinate can be fractions.
For example (row,col) = (0.5,0.5) computes the (x,y) co-ordinate of
the centre of the upper left pixel. Secondly, the row and column co-ordinate
don't have to be on the map. They are just relative to upper left position.
For example (row,col) = (-0.5,0.5) computes the (x,y) co-ordinate of
the centre of the pixel that is right above upper left pixel.
.SH "RETURNS"
0  if the co-ordinate is outside the map.
1 if inside.
-1 in case of an error.
