<h1>NAME</h1>
RrowCol2Coords - compute true world co-ordinate from row, column index
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre>#include &quot;csf.h&quot;

int RrowCol2Coords
(
	const MAP *m,
	double row,
	double col,
	double *x,
	double *y
);
</pre>
<h1>PARAMETERS</h1>
<dl><dt>
const MAP *m<dd>
map handle
<dt>
double row<dd>
Row number (relates to y position).
<dt>
double col<dd>
Column number (relates to x position).
<dt>
double *x<dd>
write-only. x co-ordinate
<dt>
double *y<dd>
write-only. y co-ordinate
</dl>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
RrowCol2Coords computes the true world co-ordinate from a
row, column index. The row,column co-ordinate can be fractions.
For example (row,col) = (0.5,0.5) computes the (x,y) co-ordinate of
the centre of the upper left pixel. Secondly, the row and column co-ordinate
don't have to be on the map. They are just relative to upper left position.
For example (row,col) = (-0.5,0.5) computes the (x,y) co-ordinate of
the centre of the pixel that is right above upper left pixel.
<h1>RETURNS</h1>
0  if the co-ordinate is outside the map.
1 if inside.
-1 in case of an error.
<h1>MERRNO</h1>
ILL_CELLSIZE
