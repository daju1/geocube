<h1>NAME</h1>
MputProjection - change projection type of map
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<pre>#include &quot;csf.h&quot;

CSF_PT MputProjection
(
	MAP *map,
	CSF_PT p
);
</pre>
<h1>PARAMETERS</h1>
<dl><dt>
MAP *map<dd>
map handle
<dt>
CSF_PT p<dd>
projection type, all nonzero values are mapped to
1 (PT_YDECT2B)
<p>
Possible values for a <pre>CSF_PT</pre>
 are as follows:
	* these two can be returned by or passed to a csf2 function 
<ul><li>PT_YINCT2B - Y increase from top to bottom.<p>
<li>PT_YDECT2B - Y decrease from top to bottom.<p>
</ul>	* this one CANNOT be returned by NOR passed to a csf2 function 
<ul><li>PT_UNDEFINED - Just some value different from the rest.<p>
</ul></dl>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
MputProjection type changes the projection type of a map.
In version 2, projections are simplified. We only discern between
a projection with y increasing (PT_YINCT2B=0) and decreasing (PT_YDECT2B=1)
from top to bottom.
All old constants that denote a projection with y decreasing are nonzero.
And the old constant that denote a projection with y decreasing (PT_XY) is 0.
<h1>RETURNS</h1>
the new projection (PT_YINCT2B or PT_YDECT2B) or MV_UINT2 if an
error occurred.
<p>
Possible values for a <pre>CSF_PT</pre>
 are as follows:
	* these two can be returned by or passed to a csf2 function 
<ul><li>PT_YINCT2B - Y increase from top to bottom.<p>
<li>PT_YDECT2B - Y decrease from top to bottom.<p>
</ul>	* this one CANNOT be returned by NOR passed to a csf2 function 
<ul><li>PT_UNDEFINED - Just some value different from the rest.<p>
