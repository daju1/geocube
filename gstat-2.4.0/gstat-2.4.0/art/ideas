Complexity of simuting random fields, using the sequential simulation
algorithm.

N data
n neighbourhood size
q simulation locations
p simulations 

kriging: O(n^2)
neigbourhood: N log N (qsort), N (blocks), < N (grid)

first simulation: kriging + neighbourhood 

subsequent simulation: updating O(n)

multiple simulation O(n^2) + p * O(n)

if p >> n : multiple simulation -> O(p)
