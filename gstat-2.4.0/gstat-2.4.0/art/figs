@B{Figure 4.} Example of recursive multi-steps simulation on a grid with
13 rows and 11 columns (circles in C). The coarsest grid with a factor 2
grid spacing is randomly placed (A: a 2 @Multiply 2 grid with 8-cell
grid spacing) and the random path is started through these cells.  Next,
a grid with a halved cell spacing is randomly placed (4-cell grid
spacing, black circles in B) and the random path is continued through
them. Next, the random path is continued through the next randomly
placed grid with halved grid spacing (2-cell grid spacing, black circles
in C). Finally, the random path is completed through the remaining cells
of the simulation grid (grey circles in C)
