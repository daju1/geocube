Gstat is a computer program for variogram modelling, and geostatistical
prediction and simulation. It provides a generic implementation of the
multivariable linear model with trends modelled as a linear function of
coordinate polynomials or of user-defined base functions, and
independent or dependent, geostatistically modelled, residuals.
Simulation in gstat comprises conditional or unconditional (multi-)
Gaussian sequential simulation of point values or block averages, or
(multi-) indicator sequential simulation.  Besides many of the common
options found in other geostatistical software packages, gstat offers
the unique combination of (i) an interactive user interface for
modelling variograms and generalized covariances (residual variograms),
that uses the device-independent plotting program gnuplot for graphical
display, (ii) support for several ascii and binary data and map file
formats for input and output, (iii) a concise, intuitive and flexible
command language, (iv) user customisation of program defaults (v) no
built-in limits, and (vi) free, portable @S ansi-c source code. This
paper describes the class of problems gstat can solve, and addresses
aspects of efficiency and implementation, managing geostatistical
projects, and relevant technical details.
