Most of gstat was written during the first author's PhD research at the
Department of Physical Geography at Utrecht University and the laboratory
of soil and groundwater research of the Dutch National Institute of Public
Health and the Environment (RIVM), and during a postdoc research at the
landscape and environmental research group, University of Amsterdam. Many
people have contributed with ideas, bug reports or otherwise, especially
P.A. Burrough, G.B.M. Heuvelink, S. Joyce, and D.J. Karssenberg. Two
anonymous reviewers provided helpful comments.
