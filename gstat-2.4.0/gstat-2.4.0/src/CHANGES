	Added more.c (callable from menu). (removed later on...)
	syntax change: `pars:x=value;' to `set x=value;' (like gnuplot)
	Made `width' and `cutoff' global variables (`set cutoff=15,width=1').
	fit.c: now use lm.c routines for the fitting (estimation),
	Changed convergence criterion in WlsFit(), Mivque():
	gl_fit_limit: Wlsfit max ||delta RSS||, Mivque max||delta teta||
	gl_iter: max. nr of iterations. Warning if reached without converg.
	added 'direction' menu option, ev->is_directional added, winds.

Mon Apr 17 00:42:17 WET DST 1995 -> 1.4f. When will 1.5 ship?
	fixed bug in fit.c: infinite weights now only if fabs(s) < 1.0e-10.
	fixed bug in fit.c, gnufit.c: weights are now N[h]/(model(h)**2)
	added `set zeroaxis' to gnuplot (plot.c)
	variogram cloud now in memory, more like sample variogram, and
	number display gives the pair of original observation numbers.
	Added gl_dots, `set dots=300': if more then this number of est. are drawn,
	switch from points (+) to dots (.) on gnuplot displays (def. 300).
Sat May  6 15:34:02 WET DST 1995 -> 1.4g

Sat May 20 11:58:46 WET DST 1995 ->1.4h
	changed prediction structure: now one loop for mask/points():
	(predict.c now replaces cs.c, mask.c and valid_points() in xvalid.c)
	set_seed in main(), to set seed or time_seed. (400 code lines saving)
	mask loops now on cell basis (non-buffered),
	now using Rdup(), and coords <--> row/col routines from csf.
	now LX_SYMBOL is returned by lex to catch errors from the menu.
	method:map; now works for many masks (<=n_outfl), what_is_outfile adapted
	vgm in glvars.c now not one array, but a pointer array (no need to
	allocate cross variograms if they're not needed: it's n**2 behavior!)
	added set_key (gnuplot36) for smart key placement.
	now '&' uses system() to call jgraph: portable.
	for `method:cs' made mask map count to 100%, dummy data works (select.c).
	when quitting the menu with `q', prompt for save settings.
	removed GNUPLOT36, added command line option -g gp35 (for display)
Sat Jun 10 15:07:08 WET DST 1995

	changed n_ok to n_uk
	changed all `alfa' to `alpha'
	added `set jgraph=1;' to output jgraph plot on plot: 'file';
	in get_est(): if stratum >= n_vars, return;

	plot.c: gnuplot_variogram [xy]range %g -> %e (for gnuplot 3.5 dos)
	changed gnuplot's fit driver (uncertainties are error standard deviations)
Thu Jun 22 14:55:44 METDST 1995 [1.5a -> Marc, Gerard]
	now stratification mask may be UINT1 or UINT2 (up to 65534 strata) 
	dX in manual; command line option -s for complete silence.
	<Tab> directly shows plot (menu.c)
	read $GSTATRC or $HOME/.gstatrc as initialisation file, before c.l.options
	(this replaces references to GNUPLOT, -g, GSTATFMT, GNUPROLOG)
	added to set-command: `intervals', `fraction', `pager', `prolog',
	`gnuplot', `gnuplot35', `format', `plot', `output'.
	I put all set-options in an ordered table structure, minimized
	abbrev. length; added @Index entries to manual; warning on `null
	character(s)' now appears only once or twice
	Bug in getest.c (1.5a) removed: neglect stratum when get_mode() != STRATIFY.
	percent_done() now outputs once a second at most.
	merged gl_verbose into debug_level; c.l.o. -d # or -s
	added variogram map, when method:sem|cov; and mask:'map';
	removed minor `buglet' in getest.c: where->X += ..n_X; without resetting.
	now added efficient multiple/stratified global kriging by attaching the
	kriging matrix and permutation matrix on the data structure.
Mon Jul  3 13:43:20 WET DST 1995 [1.5b -> Marc, Gerard]
	hp-lint checks.
	removed bug: predict() called select_at() when stratum >= get_n_vars()
	Indicator simulation when method: is; (in sim.c) using cumulative
	indicators (set cdf=1;) or disjunct indicators (default).
	in menu: MIVQUE is now optional only for direct [co]variograms; fitting
	with weights (..., N(h)/gamma(h) )  only for variograms.
Sat Jul 29 15:55:51 WET DST 1995
	Created variogram tables, and removed them: effect too small.
	vario.h (Covariance): fixed macro bug, probably has effect on Mivque().
	Fixed the variogram vs. covariogram problems: now variograms are true
	variograms, even in covariance fitting; covariograms show variogram
	models, drawn as covariogram.
	sem.c (INDEX): distance 5 now in interval <4..5], not [5..6>
	error.c (ErrMsg): changed appearance of error messages (file/line: -d2)
	error.c (pr_warning): no NL before warning
	error.c (ErrMsg): ER_NULL gives a bug message.
	sem.c (semivariance): check d->colnvariance before subtracting variances
	sem.c (covariance, cross_semivariance): handle data->variances.
	select.c (select_at) select_at(..., NULL) always gives global selection.
	utils.c: added string_prompt(): command reading from stdin, prompt gstat>,
	or non-interactively from stdin, without prompt: at `gstat -' only.
	removed bell, rotate symbol, time coordinate in DATA.
Wed Aug  2 11:24:12 METDST 1995 -> towards v. 1.6
-	minor beaty modifications in mivque.c; call it reml throughout.
-	DEF_fit_limit changed from 1.0e-7 to 1.0e-5 (should be enough!)
-	fit.c: correction for (vp->ev->zero == ZERO_AVOID)
-	fit.c: wls_fit(): added PERM to select rows with nh > 0, to aid
	singularity detection
-	added wls.c: wls_trend() and make_residuals_wls() (the last step...)
-	Now `kriging the trend', or WLS estimation of x0'beta, and wls residuals.
-	Optimized mivque() and wls_trend() by not using m_inverse()
-	sem.c: corrected default behaviour at distance zero 
-	fit.c: added R2 to fit diagnostics

-	fit.c: if v->part[i].sill == 0.0, set it to 1.0 
-	gstat.h: wrapped around some debug options
-	lm.c: corrected SSReg with weights
-	skrige.c, krige.c, wls.c, lm.c, mivque.c:
	now all use symmetry of matrices -> LDLfactor or CHfactor, and solve.
-	(..., vario.[ch], data.[ch]): removed references to asymmetric variogram
	models and zonal anysotropy (never used or tested).
-	fit.c: variogram cloud fitting, weights n_h -> unweighted fitting;
-	plot.c: variogram numbers display: only when n_est <= gl_dots
-	changed DEF_dots to 500
(24/8/95: 1.6 pre release + man -> Derkjan)
-	gstat.c: always exit after start_menu() returned (residuals would mess up).
-	writecmd.c/glvars.c: dump_all() and write_cmd() now both call write_glvars().
- 	fit.c: set 0 sill par. to 1. only when fit
-	lex.l: added `new_source': initialize lastnl each time a new source is set.

-	menu.c: call initscr() only at start, refresh() after subsequent endwin()s.
	(now works well with gnuplot beta 224, term linux)
-	krige.c: the way to handle C in estimation (co)variance is now clearer,
	more consistent (now I use `generalized covariance' C-gamma everywhere)
-	vario_fn.c: fn_intercept() returns 1.0 always
-	vario.h: Covariance() macro: when model is INTERCEPT, return 1.0, not 0.0
	(would cause a singularity in fitting) [[so INTERCEPT is a real intercept
	and therefore indeed different for variogram or covariograms!!]]
-	merged krige.c, skrige.c and wls.c into gls.c; modified getest.c
	accordingly.
-	vario.c, check_variography(): added function is_posdef(VARIOGRAM *)

Thu Oct 26 16:42:32 WET 1995
-	getest.c: Inverse Distance now also calculates block averages

-	select.c: if get_method()==SPREAD, sort selection always on distances 
-	glvars.[ch], writecmd.c: added gl_number; number display in variogram plots
-	menu.[ch]: changed references to `increment' to `(interval) width'

-	predict.c: added Rcompare() multiple mask map comparison check
-	several: RreadAs() -> RuseAs() if CSF2, except for mask map checking.

-	polygon.c (data.[ch], getest.c): added point-in-polygon stuff.
Mon Dec  4 15:42:40 MET 1995
-	menu.c: added help_menu entries, PDCurses choked on the long lines
Mon Dec 11 12:08:09 MET 1995

	(set one point in points() at area centre; then centre area to (0,0,0)
-	glvars.[ch], parsecmd.c, read.c: added gl_mv_string, to enable global
	setting of the MV-string, e.g. for expressions like: set mv="MisVal";

	adjustment, when a parameter is not fitted.
-	data.[ch], parsecmd.c, sem.c: added data->residual (default 1), decides
	whether residuals will be calculated before (co)variogram calculation
	(irrespective the value of dX).
Thu Mar 22 12:03:04     1996

	this can be surpressed by setting the env. variable GNUTERM to x11
Tue Jun  4 11:52:22 WET DST 1996
-	data.[ch], parsecmd.c: added POLI_ entries, allows use of x,y,z,x2,xy,...
	in definition of X, to simplify coordinate-polinomial trend modelling.

Tue Jul  2 15:38:36 WET DST 1996
-	added mapio.[ch]: transparent functions for multiple map formats;
	removed most of the csf.h/csftypes.h from source files (now only
	utils.c uses the [SET|IS]_MV_REAL[4|8] macro's; mapio uses csf.h).
Wed Jul 17 14:09:06 WET DST 1996
-	data.c: added read_idrisi_...() functions, for reading idrisi vector
	(point) files (.vec, .vdc). Don't think writing such files is necessary.

Thu Aug 22 15:26:11 WET DST 1996
	added several routines in sim.c; reshaped GS/IS part in getest.c in
	order to allow multiple simulations following one single random path.
	Syntax: set nsim=1000; (seems to work now).
	added `set gifsize=0.75;' -- let gnuplot produce gif output instead of eps.
Mon Aug 26 15:26:43 WET DST 1996
	sim.c: added lhs() latin hypercube sample reordering scheme.
	Syntax: set lhs = 1;
	repared bug in mivque.c; fit method `reml' works fine again
	restructured mivque.c; removed gl_nll references (now -d DB_ORDER)
Thu Aug 29 12:00:21 WET DST 1996

	output:'file';' are now accepted
Thu Sep  5 10:50:03 WET DST 1996
	added get_minmax_y() to plot.c, max_y depends now on max_x.
