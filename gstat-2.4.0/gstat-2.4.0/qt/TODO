check meschach errors (force one during a fit--is this possible?)

check refit and recalc more thoroughly (now everything is redone always)

After decreasing cutoff, the x-axis maximum is not reset

allow for fit=5 (reml fit)

load data - fit varriogram - load data - click nugget -> core
(assertion gstatwrp.cc 567 where >= 0)

Auto fit gives 3 repaints before the fit starts

If variogram model widget is active but behind the main widget, pressing
the model button does not push it to the foreground (linux & windows)

NT -- if mask map definition is in command file, exit with
file read error (converting null characters to space...).


LATER -------------:

Modify (or allow a choice) of fit methods -- this one may be unstable.
