<h1>OSSFIM: <a href="ossfim_form.html">html-version</a></h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
When we want to map a spatial attribute, such as a soil property, in a
given region we can do this by regular sampling of the area. For this, we
have to choose a sampling density, which leads to the sample size needed.
In addition, we can choose to map (estimate) the soil property not for
individual (point-support) locations, but rather for (means of) blocks
of a larger size. When planning a survey, <a href="spacing.gif">sample
spacing</a> and <a href="block.gif">block size</a> are two factors that
can be chosen. Given the variogram of the attribute to be mapped, block
kriging prediction errors can be calculated ahead of the survey for any
combination of sample spacing, block size and kriging neighbourhood.
Often, another ``controllable factor'' is the support of the attribute
measured. E.g., point samples of a varying physical size (support) can
be taken, or (random) samples from a small area can be mixed. Varying
the measurement support has an effect on the variogram of the attribute.
</p>

<p>Consider the following map:</p>

<p><img src="map.gif"></p>

<p>The program OSSFIM (optimal sampling schemes for isarithmic mapping)
calculates block kriging standard (prediction) errors as a function of
<a href="spacing.gif">sample spacing</a> and <a href="block.gif">block
size</a>. This web version uses <a href="http://www.gstat.org/">gstat</a>
and <a href="http://www.gnuplot.org/">gnuplot</a> for this. A
two-dimensional grid is formed by a range of sample spacings (x) and block
sizes (y), each divided in 10 steps. Given a kriging neigbourhood size,
ordinary block kriging standard errors are obtained for each combination
of sample spacing and block size on the grid defined. Output is given as
a colour graph, or as raw (x,y,z) data. Raw output can be cut and pasted
into a spreadsheet (such as Excell) and graphed by a contouring program
(such as S-Plus): see <a href="ossfim.pdf">example</a>.  </p>

<p> Load this <a href="ossfim_form.html">form</a> to run the html-version
of OSSFIM.  </p>

<h2>Differences from the original OSSFIM version</h2>

<p> The original OSSFIM program by McBratney and Webster has more options
than this web-version: it can handle triangular grids, it can handle the
case where the block is centered around a sample point, and it deals with
variograms with anisotropy. Gstat can calculate block kriging standard
errors in all these cases, but not through this html-interface.  </p>

<h2>Finer grids</h2>

<p> Finer grids can be obtained by adding for instance 

<pre>-x 100 -y 100</pre> 

to the gstat command line options. This option is not made possible
here, as it would put too much load on the server. Instead, <a
href="http://www.gstat.org/">gstat</a> should be run locally.  </p>
