  \class dimeLayer dime/Layer.h
  \brief The dimeLayer class handles layers.

  Each entity will have a pointer to a dimeLayer class. If no layer
  is specified by the user, a pointer to a default layer will be used.
  An instance of this class can only be constructed by the dimeModel
  class.

  To add new layers to your model, you must use the dimeLayerTable
  class, and add them to a dimeTablesSection.

  \sa dimeModel::addLayer()
